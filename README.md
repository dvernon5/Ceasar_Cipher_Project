# Ceasar Cipher Project

A solution to the Ceaser Cipher Project.

## Description
The Caesar Cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques in cryptography. It is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter that is a fixed number of position down the alphabet.

For example, with a left shift of 3, the letter 'D' would be replaced by 'A', 'E' would become 'B', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

This project implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption and decryption algorithm in C++. It provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) for encrypting and decrypting messages using a specified shift value.
